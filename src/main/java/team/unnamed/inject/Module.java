 * You can also use annotations to bind abstractions to implementations
 * like {@link Targetted} and {@link ProvidedBy}.
 *
 * <p>Read about the embedded dsl to configure injector in {@link Binder}.</p>
 *
 * <p>You can also create provider methods (methods used as providers) and
 * annotate it with {@link Provides}. Annotate the method with
 * {@link Inject} if the object creation has dependencies.</p>
 *
 * <p>There's an extension for users to create bindings in a pretty way
 * using {@link AbstractModule}.</p>
